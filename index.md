Hi there! My name is Mo Huang and I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in Statistics at
The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. I'm expecting to graduate
in 2020.

I am broadly interested in applications of statistics
and machine learning to solve real world problems. My PhD research has been 
focused on developing and applying statistical methods in the field of 
genomics, with an emphasis on methods for denoising single-cell RNA
sequencing.

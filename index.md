Hi there! My name is Mo Huang and I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in Statistics at
The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. I'm expecting to graduate
in May 2020. 

My PhD research has been focused on developing and applying 
statistical methods in the field of genomics, with an emphasis on methods for 
denoising single-cell RNA sequencing data. I'm also interested in statistical
computing, machine learning and deep learning, and applications in biology and 
healthcare.

I'm currently looking for opportunities in the fields of life sciences, data 
science, and health tech.

Hi there! My name is Mo Huang and I'm a Senior Scientist in Biostatistics at 
Merck working on early oncology clinical trials and biomarkers.

I received a PhD in Statistics at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
My research was focused on developing and applying 
statistical methods in the field of genomics, with an emphasis on methods for 
denoising single-cell RNA sequencing data. 

I also have interests in data science, machine learning and deep learning, 
and applied statistical problems in biology and healthcare.
